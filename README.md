The RAMPS WiFi Adapter provides wireless networking for RepRap's RAMPS (Arduino Mega Pololu Shield) controller.

News:
6/19/2013 - Version 0.2 is ready to be ordered and tested. The LM358DMR2G is replacing the TLV2452CDGKR and voltage
            dividers are being added along with a pullup and pulldown resistor. The first version has some errors.
            Overdriving the TLV2452CDGKR inputs at 5V with 3.3V supply is not possible. Replacing it with a LM358DMR2G
            works, however, a pullup resistor for RESET and a pulldown resistor for GPIO9 on the RN-171 is needed
            whenever jumpers are not connected. Besides these issues, Version 0.1 is able to connect and send data. The
            antenna appears very capable.

5/13/2013 - Boards for the first version have been ordered and testing will begin soon.
